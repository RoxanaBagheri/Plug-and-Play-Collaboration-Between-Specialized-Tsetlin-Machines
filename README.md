# Plug-and-Play Collaboration Between Specialized Tsetlin Machines

This project introduces plug-and-play teaming of specialized Tsetlin machines (TMs), fostering collaboration. 
* The collaboration relies on the ability of TMs to specialize and assess their confidence.
* When teaming up, the TMs that are most confident step in and make decisions, relieving those less confident. In this manner, the team becomes significantly more competent than the members alone.
* Evaluating the team performance on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, reporting a percentage increase of two points for Fashion-MNIST, twelve points for CIFAR-10, and nine points for CIFAR-100.

In conclusion, the team-based approach sets the new state-of-the-art performance for TMs across the three datasets.
